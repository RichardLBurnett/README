# Project Title

Prediction Of Passenger Demographics Using Uber Or Lyft Ridesharing

## Summary

Ridesharing alternatives in the Unites States such as Uber and Lyft gives a degree of mobility for consumers in need of traveling short distances within a specific time period. The likelihood of determining clear dempgraphics on the potential users could be made clearer by defining specific parameters, such as pickup and drop-off points, time of day, pricing schhemes, for example. Without compromising privacy issues, it may be possible to determine the age and gender of passengers based on those paramenters.  


## Background

What problems does this project solve? Making ridesharing more efficient and responsive to the needs of the public-at-large and specific demographics. 


## How is project to be used?

Third-party data analytics companies could offer such a service to university researchers, for example, in modeling the effectiveness of such modern transportation services.

## Challenges

Obvious challenge would be for Uber AND Lyft to grant permission to mine their datasets for a short-term project, without compromising their proprietary software, and not violating established United States regulations on data privacy.

## What next?

By establishing pickup and drop-off patterns over a period of time, the resulting data could be used to further refine the availability of Uber and Lyft drivers in specific location, at specific times of the day or night, to better serve the general population
